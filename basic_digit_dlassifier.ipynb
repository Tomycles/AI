    "The remaining step is to use this gradient to **step** (or **update**) the parameters which is nothing but the training process. We group all the steps in a single function which does the following: For every mini-batch in train_dataloader it computes the gradient of it using model and then, for each parameter, w and b, it updates them by shifting them by the gradients times a learning rate that we have to fix. Notice that this very step is also a function over the parameters, so, in principle, when using backprop, this step would be also taken into account to compute the gradient. This would be undesired and so to avoid it we apply the shift to p.data instead to the whole p variables. Finally, we use grad.zero_() to reset the gradients of p to zero before changing to the next mini-batch, otherwise backprop would keep adding previous gradients to the result yet we want just the one computed for a single mini-batch at the time."
